Homework 14: MVC Tech Blog using express, sequelize, and handlebars 

## Deployed Application

This application will be deployed on Heroku. At the time of writing heroku's verify users feature is down so I cannot verify my account to gain acess to the JAWSDB that would power this app. 

## Description

This fullstack application is a CMS style blog. The frontend uses the handlebars templating engine to render the html pages while the backend is powered with a Node.js express server and a mysql database. 

In this app users can create an account, log in, create posts, comment on posts, and delete their post.
